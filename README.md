netforce.py is a python script that calculates the net force in a planar central
force system.

## What you can do
    - enter forces with an angle
    - remove force angle pairs
    - print a table with all forces
    - plot the force system


## What it needs
    netforce.py uses the following imports:
	- sys
	- os
	- re
	- math
	- matplotlib


## Why it exists
    I created it to learn python and to avoid using Excel in school.
